    <div class="article">
        <h1><i>Attack on Titan</i> was originally a manga, but has also been adapted into a four season long anime. The plot of the show follows Eren Yeager. Eren is a young boy who has lived his whole life in a town on an island that is surrounded by 165 foot walls. </h1>
        <h2>These walls were designed to keep giant, humanoid monsters out of the town. These monsters seem to aimlessly roam until they find victims (humans). Nobody in the town knows where they came from or what their meaning is.</h2>
        <h3>Eren has a mission to travel outside of the walls and experience true freedom with his friends Mikasa and Armin, but the journey ahead is long and difficult.</h3>
        <h4>The show ultimately follows the drastic change of many characters and involves too many plot twists to count. It is truly something that keeps you on your toes as you watch.</h4>
